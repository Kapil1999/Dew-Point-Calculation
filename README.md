# Dew-Point-Calculation
#Contains MATLAB Code for Digitalization of Non-Linear Data#

This code can be used to visulatize the variation in Dew point measurement with respect to the following aspects:
1. Temperature vs Date
2. Humidity vs Date
3. Dew Point vs Date
4. Measurement vs Time

Thank you! for reading till the end! :)
